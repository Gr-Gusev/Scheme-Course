Hello, bob!
What seems to be the trouble?
**My study

**Test message
Health-Care workers are another segment of population particularly affected by stress.
**Test covid
This increased attention might help in managing the psychological effects of the pandemic while respondents from china suffer the least with regards to psychopathological disorders compared to those ones excessively use or do not use social networks at all.
**Pandemic! Fear! Panic..
Why do you think that fear?
**Tesing the program
Even considering the scores regarding depression and anxiety, italy is the worst affected country while, according to our research, those individuals who obtain their information from friends and family to those ones excessively use or do not use social networks at all.
**depression and anxiety
Indeed, empathy defined as the ability to understand and share the feelings of another involves several elements, such as distress sale of assets, predatory loans or child labour.
**What about depression?

**So long answer
Earlier you said that test covid.
**Go straight
On the other hand they also consider an avoidant style as a protective one, differently from anxious style.
**You have incoherent speech
Earlier you said that panic.
**Again
Health professionals also lived live in daily life a traumatic condition called secondary traumatic stress disorder, burnout syndrome, physical and emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and dissociation.
**emotional exhaustion
During sars, up to 50% of health-care professionals suffered from acute psychological stress, exhaustion, and post-traumatic stress, caused by the fear of contracting the virus.
**Test word virus pandemic covid
Please continue...
**stress, depression, exhaustion
During sars, up to 50% of health-care professionals suffered from acute psychological stress, exhaustion, and post-traumatic symptoms because they are more sensitive to stress.
**Hah
A certain correlation is therefore confirmed between negative affectivity, levels of awareness, coping strategies and psychological impact of the quarantine.
**Goodbye
